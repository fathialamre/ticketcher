# Ticketcher Package Roadmap

This roadmap outlines potential enhancements and new features for the ticketcher package, organized by implementation difficulty and impact.

## 🚀 Quick Wins (High Impact, Lower Effort)

### 1. **Pre-built Ticket Templates**
Add convenient constructors for common ticket types to make the package more accessible.

```dart
// Easy-to-use templates for common use cases
Ticketcher.eventTicket(
  eventName: "Concert",
  date: "Dec 25, 2024",
  venue: "Madison Square Garden",
  seat: "A12",
  price: "\$89.99",
);

Ticketcher.boardingPass(
  airline: "Air Flutter",
  from: "NYC",
  to: "LAX", 
  flightNumber: "FL123",
  seat: "12A",
  gate: "B7",
);

Ticketcher.coupon(
  title: "50% OFF",
  subtitle: "Winter Sale",
  code: "WINTER50",
  expiryDate: "Jan 31, 2025",
);
```

### 2. **QR Code Integration**
Built-in support for QR codes and barcodes in ticket sections.

```dart
Ticketcher(
  sections: [
    Section(child: Text("Event Info")),
    Section.qrCode(
      data: "https://event.com/ticket/12345",
      size: 80,
    ),
  ],
)
```

### 3. **Material Design 3 Theming**
Pre-built themes that work with Material Design 3 and custom theme support.

```dart
Ticketcher(
  theme: TicketTheme.material3(
    colorScheme: Theme.of(context).colorScheme,
  ),
  // or predefined themes
  theme: TicketTheme.modern(),
  theme: TicketTheme.vintage(),
  theme: TicketTheme.neon(),
)
```

### 4. **Export to Image/PDF**
Allow users to export tickets as images or PDF files for sharing or printing.

```dart
final ticketImage = await ticket.toImage();
final ticketPdf = await ticket.toPdf();
```

## 🎨 Styling Enhancements

### 5. **Glassmorphism Effects**

  gradient: LinearGradient(
    colors: [Colors.blue, Colors.purple],
  ),
  style: DividerStyle.wave,
)
```

### 8. **3D Effects**
Add depth with perspective transforms and multi-layer shadows.

```dart
TicketcherDecoration(
  effect3D: Effect3D(
    perspective: 0.001,
    rotationX: 5,
    shadowLayers: [
      BoxShadow(color: Colors.black26, blurRadius: 10, offset: Offset(0, 5)),
